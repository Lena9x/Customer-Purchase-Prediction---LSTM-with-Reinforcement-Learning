# Customer-Purchase-Prediction---LSTM-with-Reinforcement-Learning

Developed and evaluated predictive models to forecast customer purchase likelihood using historical interaction data. Compared the performance of LSTM neural networks with traditional machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Decision Trees) to identify the most accurate method. While LSTM excelled in handling temporal data, tree-based models achieved higher overall accuracy. Advanced feature engineering, including time-based features and Word2Vec embeddings, significantly improved prediction accuracy, with hyperparameter tuning boosting accuracy by over 16% for LSTM and 14% for Gradient Boosting. This project highlights the importance of combining advanced modeling with feature engineering to enhance customer targeting in e-commerce.
